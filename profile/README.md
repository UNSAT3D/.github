## Abstract

The health of soil is equally important as the health of humans; soil has to be strong enough to sustain the  built infrastructures while being functional to allow water and nutrient transport to plants. **While image processing has been a great help to support medical doctors in diagnosis, the use of images is not so straightforward for soil characterization. Difficulties arise simply because soil is random in nature** (it contains e.g., solid grains, water, and plant roots) and has living organisms (e.g., plants) constantly modifying its structure. **The project UNSAT tries to improve the identification capability of 3D image processing by training machine learning classifiers with high-fidelity, physics-based simulation data**. We are interested in how new machine-learning techniques can help us to observe water transport and how root and soil react to water cycles during the growth of young maize.
